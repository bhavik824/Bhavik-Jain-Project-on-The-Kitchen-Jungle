You don’t need a fork to eat good food….
Hi ! I am Bhavik Jain . I am a student|Travler|Food blogger|Food influencer|.

It’s been a very long time I wanted to make a website about the exciting food. But being a student it’s very difficult to spare time to write on a blog. So covid-19 give me quite a lot of time to write and create my food page ,where I can share all my food experience with you all . It’s all about my crazy food experiences about food and travel. In The Kitchen Jungle . You’ll find the Menu inspired by the people and places.I love the most.

<p align = "justify">I grew up in a very beautiful family in INDIA(PATIALA CITY). I came from family of 5. I have done my schooling from Patiala only.I began to help cook for my mother. I soon realized how much I enjoy it. From very young age I started cooking for my family when I got time and I really enjoyed it and also my favorite hobby to do. Ever since I was little I wanted to travel, love to explore with family and friends. To me traveling isn’t about relaxing or being in a holiday but also exploring people,culture,food and cuisine doing silly things sometimes at it’s best. Travel let’s you view the world with sense of awe and wonder.
It probably sound cheesy, travel make me rediscover who I am . And helped me better understanding the world I live in . It’s lot of stupid fun. So here I will sharing all my food stories and experiences.
The food I make for my family is simple, classic, and nutritious. Although it’s easy to see my passion for cooking still exists as flour and salt are main characters on this blog.
All the photos are not mine they are taken from sources.The best things in life are sweet</p>

And that’s what this space is, food that becomes our personal narrative. Recipes that become your own, stories that grow with you. Sweetness as connection. Sweetness as a means to heal. Sweetness as a way to unite the fractures of light and dark. Sweetness for you, and for me, and for us. Taking time for stillness, for softening, for slow moments in stirring batter, and devouring every bite. Life. Again, eyes wide. It’s lived in. There will be mess and crumbs and stains and spills. Because that’s what it’s all about. Learning to live with ash and ruins. There’s a beauty in brokenness, in imperfection. I know you’ve felt it too, hold onto that.
And my memories spread themselves thick over everything I do. Food forms our strongest memory. We all have it. They don’t have to be great. But we have it. I created one. I’m creating one. And with each new post, you’re all invited to a seat with my new and inspiring ideas.
